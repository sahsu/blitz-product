There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. We try to work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

有一種叫做“向後工作”的方法在Amazon中得到了廣泛的應用。我們試着從客戶那裏逆向工作，而不是從一個產品的想法開始，試圖把客戶栓在上面。雖然向後工作可以應用於任何特定的產品決策，但在開發新產品或特性時，使用這種方法尤其重要。

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

對於新的計劃，產品經理通常從編寫內部新聞稿開始，宣佈成品。新聞稿的目標受衆是新/更新產品的客戶，這些客戶可以是零售客戶，也可以是工具或技術的內部用戶。內部新聞稿集中於客戶問題，當前解決方案(內部或外部)如何失敗，以及新產品將如何吹走現有解決方案。

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

如果列出的好處對客戶來說聽起來並不有趣或令人興奮，那麼也許它們就不是(也不應該建立)。相反，產品經理應該不斷地在新聞稿中進行迭代，直到他們得到真正聽起來像好處的好處爲止。在新聞稿上迭代比在產品本身上迭代要便宜得多(而且更快！)

Here's an example outline for the press release:
Heading - Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
Sub-Heading - Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
Summary - Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
Problem - Describe the problem your product solves.
Solution - Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
Quote from You - A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
How to Get Started - Describe how easy it is to get started.
Customer Quote - Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
Closing and Call to Action - Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

以下是新聞稿的一個示例大綱：標題-以讀者(即您的目標客戶)理解的方式命名該產品。副標題-描述誰是產品的市場和他們得到什麼好處。只有一個句子在標題下面。總結-對產品和效益進行總結。假設讀者不會再讀任何其他東西，所以要把這一段寫得很好。問題-描述你的產品解決的問題。解決方案-描述您的產品如何優雅地解決問題。引用你的話-引用貴公司發言人的話。如何開始-描述它是多麼容易開始。客戶報價結束並呼籲行動-把它疊起來，給出讀者下一步應該去的方向。

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

如果新聞稿超過一頁半，可能太長了。保持簡單。大多數段落的3-4句話。把脂肪切掉。別把它變成規範。您可以在新聞稿中附帶一個常見問題，回答所有其他業務或執行問題，這樣新聞稿就可以集中於客戶得到的內容。我的經驗法則是，如果新聞稿很難寫出來，那麼這個產品可能會很爛。繼續努力，直到每個段落的大綱流出來。

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

哦，我還喜歡爲主流消費產品寫新聞稿，我稱之爲“奧普拉-代言人”。想象一下，你坐在奧普拉的沙發上，剛剛向她解釋了這個產品，然後當她向她的觀衆解釋時，你聽了。那是“奧普拉-說”，而不是“極客-說”。

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).


一旦項目進入開發階段，新聞稿就可以作爲試金石；一盞指導性的燈。產品團隊可以問自己：“我們在建立新聞稿中的內容嗎？”如果他們發現自己花了很多時間去製作新聞稿中沒有的東西(過度建造)，他們需要問自己爲什麼。這使得產品開發集中於實現客戶利益，而不是構建需要更長時間、需要資源來維護和沒有提供真正的客戶利益(至少不足以保證包含在新聞稿中)的無關的東西。
