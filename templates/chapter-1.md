第一章

1 -- Give them the current state of whatever you topic is.

告訴他們你所討論的話題的現狀。

E.g. If you're writing about fat loss then tell them some statistics
about how 90% of Americans are overweight.

例如：如果你在寫關於減肥的文章，那就告訴他們90%的美國人是如何超重的。

2 -- Tell them a little bit of history of your industry. What happened
before the big change? Why are we in this current state?

告訴他們你這個行業的一些歷史。大變化之前發生了什麼？爲什麼我們現在這樣？

3 -- Tell them the BAD NEWS

告訴他們壞消息

E.g. Again, if you are writing about fat loss, tell them that it's
actually getting worse.

例如：再一次，如果你在寫關於脂肪流失的文章，告訴他們它實際上正在變得更糟。

4 -- Tell them who WIN'S and who LOSES in the big shift that is
happening.

告訴他們誰贏了誰輸了正在發生的大轉變。

E.g. Continuing the fat loss example, tell them how a group of people
are starting a revolution against junk food (the winners) and how those
who are not adapting fast enough (the losers) are going to continue to
gain weight and possibly die early.

例如：繼續這個減肥的例子，告訴他們一羣人是如何開始一場反對垃圾食品的革命的(優勝者)，以及那些沒有適應足夠快的人(失敗者)將如何繼續增加體重並可能過早死亡。

5 -- Tell them the GOOD NEWS

告訴他們好消息

If there's bad news, then there's also good news. Ask them to join the
WINNERS if they want to solve their problems, achieve success -- or get
whatever results they want to get.

如果有壞消息，也有好消息。如果他們想解決他們的問題，取得成功，或者取得他們想要的任何結果，請他們加入優勝者。
